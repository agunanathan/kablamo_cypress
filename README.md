# Steps:

1.  Clone Repo
2.  Run "npm install"

# Tests:
There are two cypress test scripts:

    1. reusable_forex_rate_api_test_for_num_of_weeks.cy.js
    
    2. cad_to_aud_forex_rate_over_10_weeks.cy.js
    

# Running the tests on CLI:

- # Running tests individually:
  
  Script1: cad_to_aud_forex_rate_over_10_weeks.cy.js

  CLI Command: npx cypress run --spec cypress/e2e/cad_to_aud_forex_rate_over_10_weeks.cy.js


  Script2: reusable_forex_rate_api_test_for_num_of_weeks.cy.js
  
  CLI Command: npx cypress run --env baseCurrency=USD,targetCurrency=CAD,weeks=10 --spec cypress/e2e/reusable_forex_rate_api_test_for_num_of_weeks.cy.js  // Note: weeks, baseCurrency and targetCurrency can be changed here before running


- # Running both tests together on CLI:
  
  CLI command: npx cypress run --env baseCurrency=USD,targetCurrency=CAD,weeks=10 // Note: weeks, baseCurrency and targetCurrency can be changed here before running

  

# Running tests on Cypress Test Runner:
  
  Command: npx cypress open

  Then choose the E2E Testing on a browser of choice (chrome for example) and run the scripts


# Things that could still need some work:
1.  Finding a way to add cy.logs to the html report.
2.  Adding more negative tests (may need more context of API functionality and understanding of business rules)
  

# The Ask (Modified to explain what tools were used to complete the tasks):

ðŸš€Mission

- Lightweight API automation framework using JavaScript utilizing Cypress.

ðŸŽ¯ Target

- Automate the following scenarios using valet API from the Bank of Canada :
  https://www.bankofcanada.ca/valet/docs :
- Find the average Forex conversion rate, "CAD to AUD," for the recent 10 weeks using
  observations by Series.
- Include assertions for positive and negative scenarios to ensure the accuracy and reliability of
  the API response.

ðŸ’ª Stretch Goals:

- HTML reporting has been setup to use mochawesome.
  html report showing test results can be found in cypress>e2e>reports folder (index.html); generated new after every run
- Additional negative scenarios added to test error-handling capabilities.
- Code resusability has been setup to be able to pass in baseCurrency and targetCurrency along with numOfWeeks as cypress environment variables when run from CLI.
- Note that some baseCurrency targetCurrency parameters seem to have response body with Series not found. Tried to trouble shoot but not sure why but the following as an example:

  "message": "Series FXUSDAUD not found.",
  "docs": "https://www.bankofcanada.ca/valet/docs"
